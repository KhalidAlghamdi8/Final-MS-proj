ABSTRACT

 The purpose of this application is to develop an ATM system application which is able to
collect real-time face image and recognize the face by comparing with the datasets inside the
system and getting the personal details if there is a match, also, the system will be able to detect
eyes, face recognition as a type of biometric method has the features of non-contact, safety, and
convenience. It is widely used in human-computer interaction, transaction authentication, security,
and other fields. In recent years, with the development of mobile internet and an embedded
computer, it becomes possible to run face recognition on an embedded system. This type of
application has enormous potential in remote payment and personal information security. This
application is running on any operating system such as windows, linux, or mac, the procedure of
face recognition includes persistent storage for trained Faces Image Using Database, face, eyes,
normalization, and Recognition. This paper aimed to develop a real-time face detection module that
analyzes the picture taken by the camera recognizes if a person's face is pictured and determines
whether it is covered or not.
